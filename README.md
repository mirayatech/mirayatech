### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
 
I'm [**Miraya**](https://miraya.tech), a software engineer based in Germany.   

I like combining my technical knowledge with design to make beautiful and efficient applications. My goal is to build scalable and efficient software while providing engaging and flawless user experiences.

Outside of work, I'm interested in furthering my knowledge in the tech world. I also build many side projects (most of them are in private repositories) and create tech-related Instagram posts (75,000 followers and counting).


#### Fun Facts:
- I don't like coffee or tea.
- Demon Slayer is my favorite anime.
- Outside of coding, I enjoy drawing.
