### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Miraya**](https://www.miraya.tech), a frontend design engineer based in Germany.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or drawing. I also enjoy writing [blog posts](https://mirayatech.hashnode.dev/) and sharing tech-related content on social media (over 130K combined followers and counting).

#### Fun Facts:

* I don’t like coffee or tea.
* Demon Slayer is my favorite anime.
